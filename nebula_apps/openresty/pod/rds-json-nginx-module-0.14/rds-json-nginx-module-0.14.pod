=head1 Description

This module provides an output filter that can format the RDS outputs
generated by L<ngx_drizzle|https://github.com/openresty/drizzle-nginx-module>
and L<ngx_postgres|https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_postgres/> modules to JSON.




=head1 Directives




=head2 rds_json

B<syntax:> I<rds_json  on|off>

B<default:> I<rds_json off>

Enables or disables the output filter of this module.




=head2 rds_json_buffer_size

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_buffer_size   E<lt>bytesE<gt>>

B<default:> I<rds_json_buffer_size E<lt>page-sizeE<gt>>

Controls the buffer size used by this module. default to the page size (4k/8k).
The bigger the buffer size, the less streammy the conversion
will be. But usually increasing the buffer size
does help reduce CPU time.




=head2 rds_json_format

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_format  normal|compact>

B<default:> I<rds_json_format normal>

Controls the output JSON format. A sample of the default "normal" format
looks like this


     [{"id":1,"name":"marry"},{"id":2,"name":"bob"}]

while it looks like below when in the "compact" format


     [["id","name"],[1,"marry"],[2,"bob"]]

that is, the first row holds the column name list.




=head2 rds_json_root

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_root E<lt>keyE<gt>>

B<default:> I<no>

Specifies the "root" key for data rows (if any). For example,


     rds_json on;
     rds_json_root rows;

will return JSON output like this:


     {"rows":[{"id":2,"name":null},{"id":3,"name":"bob"}]}

if C<rds_json_format compact> is also specified, then the
output will look like this:


     {"rows":[["id","name"],[2,null],[3,"bob"]]}

Nginx variables are not supported in the E<lt>keyE<gt> argument of
this directive.

If this directive is not defined, neither are L<rds_json_success_property>,
nor L<rds_json_user_property>, the JSON output for select queries will
just be an array at the top level.

When either L<rds_json_success_property> or L<rds_json_user_property> are specified,
this directive takes a default argument of "data".




=head2 rds_json_success_property

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_success_property E<lt>keyE<gt>>

B<default:> I<no>

Specifies the top-level object property name used in the JSON output
for indicating success or false of the query.




=head2 rds_json_user_property

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_user_property E<lt>keyE<gt> E<lt>valueE<gt>>

B<default:> I<no>

Specifies additonal user properties for the top-level object
of the JSON output.

Multiple instances of this directives are allowed in a single scope.

Nginx variables are supported in the C<value> argument.

Both of the C<key> and C<value> arguments will be automatically
quoted according to JSON strings' notation.




=head2 rds_json_errcode_key

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_errcode_key E<lt>keyE<gt>>

B<default:> I<rds_json_errcode_key errcode>

Specifies the errcode key name used in the JSON output.




=head2 rds_json_errstr_key

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_errstr_key E<lt>keyE<gt>>

B<default:> I<rds_json_errstr_key errstr>

Specifies the errstr key name used in the JSON output.




=head2 rds_json_ret

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_ret E<lt>error-codeE<gt> E<lt>descrptionE<gt>>

B<default:> I<no>

This directive enables a content handler that simply emits
an response body like this:


     {"errcode":<error-code>,"errstr":"<description>"}

while the C<< <description> >> string will be properly quoted as
a JSON string.




=head2 rds_json_content_type

B<syntax:> I<rds_json_content_type E<lt>mime-typeE<gt>>

B<default:> I<rds_json_content_type application/json>

Controls the C<Content-Type> header of the response generated by
this module's output filter.




=head1 Installation

You're recommended to install this module (as well as the Nginx core and many other goodies) via the L<ngx_openresty bundle|http://openresty.org>. See L<the detailed instructions|http://openresty.org/#Installation> for downloading and installing ngx_openresty into your system. This is the easiest and most safe way to set things up.

Alternatively, you can install this module manually with the Nginx source:

Grab the nginx source code from L<nginx.org|http://nginx.org/>, for example,
the version 1.7.10 (see L<nginx compatibility>), and then build the source with this module:


     $ wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.7.10.tar.gz'
     $ tar -xzvf nginx-1.7.10.tar.gz
     $ cd nginx-1.7.10/
    
     # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
     $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
         --add-module=/path/to/rds-json-nginx-module
    
     $ make -j2
     $ make install

ownload the latest version of the release tarball of this module from L<echo-nginx-module file list|https://github.com/agentzh/echo-nginx-module/tags>.

Also, this module is included and enabled by default in the L<ngx_openresty bundle|http://openresty.org>.
