=head1 Synopsis


    location /foo {
        # drizzle_pass/postgres_pass/...

=head1 Description

This module implements an efficient output filter that converts
Resty-DBD-Streams (RDS) generated by L<ngx_drizzle|https://github.com/openresty/drizzle-nginx-module>
and L<ngx_postgres|https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_postgres/>
to Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format in a streaming fashion.
By default, the CSV format is in compliance with L<RFC 4180|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180>:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180

SQL NULL values will be converted to empty field value, just like
empty string values.

=head1 Installation

You're recommended to install this module (as well as the Nginx core and many other goodies) via the L<ngx_openresty bundle|http://openresty.org>. See L<the detailed instructions|http://openresty.org/#Installation> for downloading and installing ngx_openresty into your system. This is the easiest and most safe way to set things up.

Alternatively, you can install this module manually with the Nginx source:

Grab the nginx source code from L<nginx.org|http://nginx.org/>, for example,
the version 1.9.3 (see L<nginx compatibility>), and then build the source with this module:


     $ wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.9.3.tar.gz'
     $ tar -xzvf nginx-1.9.3.tar.gz
     $ cd nginx-1.9.3/
    
     # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
     $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
         --add-module=/path/to/rds-csv-nginx-module
    
     $ make -j2
     $ make install

Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from L<rds-csv-nginx-module file list|https://github.com/openresty/rds-csv-nginx-module/tags>.

Also, this module is included and enabled by default in the L<ngx_openresty bundle|http://openresty.org>.
